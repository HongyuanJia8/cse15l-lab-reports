## Part 2

**Which of these two styles would you prefer using if you had to work on a program that you were running remotely, and why?**

I prefer to use remote server. Because if I change the code in the local, and scp to the server, it usually costs a lot of time. There are so many files, 
computer needs a lot of time to upload these files. That's not efficient! If I change it on the romote server, no need to upload.

**What about the project or task might factor into your decision one way or another? (If nothing would affect your decision, say so and why!)**

If I really need VS code. I might change the code and upload it. Sometimes these IDEs(VS code, Xcode, Eclipse) are more powerful than vim.
